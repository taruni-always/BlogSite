For several hours prior to the upgrade, claiming of STRONG will be disabled. This will be announced on Twitter, on the Website, and in the DApp.     STRONG within the NaaS DApp platform will be automatically upgraded to STRNGR on a 1:1 basis. No action will be required by anyone already participating in the platform.     After the upgrade is complete, STRNGR will replace STRONG as the token used to create nodes within the NaaS DApp in current and upcoming protocols, as well as the reward token for the NaaS DApp",

              body: 'AI is nothing but intelligence that learns, re-learns, and reinforces its learning through the data that it gets. This data can either be specifically fed into the modes or designed to collect this data independently. Hence, the volume and quality of data are extremely important in determining the efficacy and relevance of AI for any purpose. Big data is a new form of information asset, and it requires massive processing models and the right computing muscle to take care of its flow, velocity, scale, and density. For Big Data to expand and extend human intelligence through AI, we would need to master many dimensions of Big Data. They would include, but would not be limited to, speech recognition, IoT and sensor data, image recognition, unstructured data, and real-time data of many formats.',
